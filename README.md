## Social Media Website Project

For this project I'm working on a social media website with basic functionalities, ability create an account, to add/remove friends, and make posts.
At the moment the project isn't complete, though a signficant chunk of it is done, in particular the backend has a signficant majority of it done. 
The backend is written using Python and the Flask framework, the frontend is being written using JavaScript and the React library.

You can take a look at the code for the backend through the backend directory, and for the frontend through the frontend directory.
